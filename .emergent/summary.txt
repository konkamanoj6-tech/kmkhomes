The AI engineer successfully established the KMK Homes real estate application from scratch, moving from mock data to a fully CMS-driven system. Initial work focused on implementing core CMS models, API routes, and an admin dashboard for properties, banners, and testimonials. Debugging efforts included resolving Pydantic v2 compatibility, CORS issues, and frontend rendering problems.

Subsequent interactions involved addressing user-reported discrepancies between agent's test results and user's view, leading to the identification and resolution of several frontend display issues (like image paths and property detail loading). New admin features for Happy Clients, News & Events, NRI Corner, and admin password change were implemented. UI modifications, such as updating contact information, simplifying public navigation, and dynamically populating property filters on the homepage, were also completed. The recurring theme is image management and display, with the latest request still focusing on persistent image upload issues and exploring self-service options.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user issues: fixing image upload, adding provided images to Villa No 59, creating Amenities CMS, fixing image expansion in property details, fixing View Details scroll to top, and resolving a missing Settings link in the admin portal.

The engineer successfully:
1.  **Updated Villa No 59**: Added user-provided images.
2.  **Created Amenities CMS**: Implemented , updated admin navigation, API services, and backend routes for amenity management.
3.  **Fixed image expansion**: Implemented an image modal with next/previous functionality in .
4.  **Fixed scroll-to-top**: Ensured  scrolls to the top on load.
5.  **Fixed Settings visibility**: Ensured  is accessible via admin navigation.

All these fixes were verified to be working. However, the user's very last message explicitly states: still if shd say u to upload the images but not able to upload i am any possible alternative u acn provde so evrytie no need to ask u. This indicates that despite previous attempts and the agent's internal verification, the core image upload and display problem persists for the user, and they are seeking an alternative solution for independent image management. The agent's last action was to acknowledge this and propose investigating the current upload system.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the current image upload system to allow users to upload images independently, as per the user's latest request.
