The AI engineer's work involved incrementally building and refining a real estate website, KMK Homes, focusing on transforming it into a fully CMS-driven application. Initial work involved setting up a React frontend with FastAPI/MongoDB backend, defining CMS models, and API routes. Key challenges included debugging frontend display issues (images, property details), resolving API data parsing inconsistencies (axios ), and ensuring correct URL handling for static assets. The engineer systematically addressed user requests, including implementing Admin Banners and Testimonials pages, adding admin password change functionality, and dynamically populating homepage filters. The most significant recent undertaking is a comprehensive redesign of the Home and Projects pages, introducing new Our Projects, Homes for Every Budget, and Plots sections, each with dedicated CMS collections, dynamic data, and YouTube integration. The engineer is currently in the process of implementing the Plots CMS and redesigning the Home page.

The goal is a dynamic, premium real estate website, KMK Homes, with a modern design (navy blue, gold accents, white/grey, Poppins/Montserrat).
**Website Structure & Content:**

Each section to include project name, location, price, type, thumbnail, YouTube link (Watch Full Tour), mini filters (Location, Property Type, Status), and View All/More/Explore buttons linking to dedicated pages.
*   **Projects Page (Redesigned):** Two tabs: Our Projects and Budget Homes. Both dynamically display all CMS listings with project name, location, price, type, thumbnail, and Watch on YouTube button/icon. Filters for Location, Price Range, Property Type (Our Projects) or Price Range, Property Type (Budget Homes).
*   **Property Detail Page:** Dedicated page per property with image slider/gallery, location map, details, Enquire Now (email/WhatsApp). Must scroll to top on load.
*   **Contact Page:** Google Maps, phone, email, WhatsApp chat.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a significant redesign of the website's structure, particularly the Home and Projects pages, to introduce new dynamic content sections and corresponding CMS capabilities.

Specifically, the engineer was working on:
1.  **Creating the  CMS collection**: A new Pydantic model () was added to  and the corresponding frontend admin page () was created as an empty placeholder.
2.  **Integrating  API endpoints and database connections**: Backend API routes for CRUD operations on  were added to  and public retrieval routes to . The frontend  was updated with corresponding methods, and the  service was added to .
3.  **Redesigning the Home page**: The engineer began a complete overhaul of . This involved replacing existing state variables, updating the  function to fetch data for Our Projects, Homes for Every Budget, and Plots from the new APIs. The Featured Projects section was replaced with the new three-section layout, incorporating placeholder designs for dynamic project display, mini filters, and calls to action.

The trajectory ends with the engineer having completed the initial structural changes and data fetching logic for the Home page, with the next logical step being to complete the admin navigation and flesh out the new project pages.
