The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a real estate website, KMK Homes, focusing on a premium design and dynamic property listings. Initially, the frontend was built with mock data to demonstrate functionality quickly. The engineer then shifted to backend integration, converting the site into a fully CMS-driven application. This involved creating extensive backend models and API routes, a data seeding script, and an admin dashboard for content management. Numerous bugs were encountered and resolved, including frontend rendering issues (component naming conflicts, missing React imports), backend compatibility problems (Pydantic v2), and API connectivity issues (CORS, incorrect backend URL). At the point of handover, the core CMS and admin login are functional, but some frontend pages require further implementation and debugging, specifically for image display, property detail page data loading, and full implementation of Admin Banners and Testimonials sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging and implementing the remaining CMS features and fixing critical frontend display issues.
Specifically, the agent was addressing the following:
1.  **Images Not Displaying**: The images were uploading but not appearing correctly in the admin panel.
2.  **Property Detail Not Found**: The dedicated property detail pages were failing to retrieve and display property information.
3.  **Coming Soon Pages**: The Home Banners and Testimonials sections in the admin panel were placeholders, requiring full implementation.

The last actions taken were:
*   Creating the  file to start implementing the Home Banners management page.
*   Starting the creation of the  file for Testimonials management, with the message  being the very last action.

This indicates the agent is in the process of building out the remaining admin pages and will subsequently need to address the image display and property detail data loading issues.
