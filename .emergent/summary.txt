The AI engineer has successfully transitioned the KMK Homes application from a basic MVP to a feature-rich, CMS-driven platform. Initial work focused on foundational CMS models, API routes, and an admin dashboard. Subsequent iterations addressed critical frontend display issues, image management challenges (leading to the implementation of direct image URL input), and UI enhancements like dynamic filters and improved navigation. New sections for Budget Homes and Open Plots were integrated, complete with dedicated CMS, public listing, and detail pages, alongside YouTube video embeds. Most recently, the engineer began implementing a Nearby Places feature using OpenStreetMap. The ongoing work involves enhancing existing functionalities and preparing for a comprehensive SEO overhaul and blog integration.
