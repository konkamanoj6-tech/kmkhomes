## üîß Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing?

**If using File Upload:**
- Images may not persist in Emergent containers
- **Solution**: Use image URLs instead (Option 2)

**If using Image URLs:**
- Make sure URL ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, or `.webp`
- URL should start with `https://`
- Test URL by pasting in browser - it should show the image

**Example Good URLs:**
‚úÖ `https://i.imgur.com/abc123.jpg`
‚úÖ `https://res.cloudinary.com/yourname/image/upload/photo.png`
‚úÖ `https://i.ibb.co/xyz/villa.jpeg`

**Example Bad URLs:**
‚ùå `imgur.com/abc123` (missing https://)
‚ùå `https://imgur.com/gallery/abc123` (gallery page, not direct image)
‚ùå `C:\Users\Photos\image.jpg` (local path)

### How to Get Direct Image URL:

1. Upload image to hosting service
2. **Right-click on image**
3. Select **"Copy image address"** or **"Copy image URL"**
4. Paste in admin panel
